# book-search-engine-project
take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. I worked on this project with my tutor, Robert Kurle Jr. on May 31st, 2024. I began refactoring on the server side by creating typeDefs and resolvers. Then I reconfigured the server.js file to proxy to graphql and reconfigured the app.jsx file to include apollo server and authentication. Then I created client side queries.js and mutations.js files. Finally I editted SignupForm.jsx, LoginForm.jsx, SavedBooks.jsx, and SearchBooks.jsx to use queries mutations and authentication through jwt.
